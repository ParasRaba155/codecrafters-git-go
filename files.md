# Files inside this project

* Inside the `testdata` directory there are many files present
* Below is the current tree view of the files

```bash
testdata
├── code-crafter-response.txt
├── pack-response.txt
├── pack.txt
├── pack_info.txt
└── response.txt
```

* Each file has it's purpose

* `code-crafter-response.txt` is a response that one get from the curl request on `https://github.com/codecrafters-io/git-sample-1`

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://github.com/codecrafters-io/git-sample-1/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack' > <file.txt>
```

* `pack-response.txt`

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://github.com/codecrafters-io/git-sample-1/git-upload-pack \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/x-git-upload-pack-request' \
  --data '0032want 47b37f1a82bfe85f6d8df52b6258b75e4343b7fd
00000009done'
```


* `response.txt`

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://github.com/rclone/rclone/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack' > <file.txt>
```

* `pack.txt`

- Almost same as the `pack-response.txt` without the PACK ACK bytes from beginning
- We need to create these for `packfile_reader`

* `pack-info.txt`: This is the file that I am using a way to verify the pack file parsing
  * It is generated by [packfile_reader](https://github.com/robisonsantos/packfile_reader)

```bash
packfile_reader ./testdata/pack.txt > ./testdata/pack_info.txt
```
